# EVE_LiveDPSGraph
Live DPS graph overlay for EVE Online. Combat-data is read directly from the combat-log for the selected user. This data is used to plot a chart showing the incoming- and outgoing damage.

### Build dependencies
To build you'll need Google's Gson 2.5.0. You can download it from here:
https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson/2.5/jar

You'll need the jar, javadoc.jar and sources.jar. To be added manually as a library in Netbeans if you use that IDE:
